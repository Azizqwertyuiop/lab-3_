  		<p class="homee">Mexican Oil Reserves</p>
        
  		<p class="homa">Mexico recently completed a new assessment of its oil reserves and estimated proven and probable oil reserves at approximately 18.7 billion barrels. Mexico’s <p class="homa">earlier assessment in 2007 estimated reserves at approximately 12.4 billion barrels in all country resources, but in 2011, the estimate was revised to 15.7 </p> <p class="homa">billion barrels to reflect additional exploration findings. Discoveries in the Sigsbee Field increase this figure by an additional 3 billion barrels.</p>


  		<p class="homee">Sigsbee Field</p>
        
  		<p class="homa">The Sigsbee Field is one of the largest gas and crude oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico, with new advances in seismic imaging and drilling leading to the discovery <p class="homa">of this new field. This offshore oil field is located approximately 150 km southeast from the city of Matamoros on the east coast of Mexico in what is often </p> <p class="homa">referred to as the “Grand Canyon under the sea.” Covering an area 30 by 15 square kilometers (12 by 5.8 sq. mi), the Sigsbee discovery is estimated to</p> <p class="homa">contain 1.2 trillion cubic meters (42 trillion cubic feet) of gas and up to 3 billion barrels of liquid crude oil. At its largest point, the field contains </p>
	 <p class="homa">a gas column that is being drilled in water that is more than 2,000 meters deep. To date, the field has been drilled to a depth of 5,861 meters.</p>
	 <p class="homa">Mexico and the United States are involved negotiations to secure access to this source of oil and gas.</p>

	<p class="homee">Four Integral Components</p>
        
  		<p class="homa">The Sigsbee Field is comprised of the following four integral components: Ojeda, Arana, Quiroga, and Orizba. These components are responsible for the production<p class="homa">, processing and transportation of oil and gas from the field.</p>
