  		<p  class="hom"> One of the primary things that stand out about Parallax Global is our unique point-of-view and approach to consulting engagements.</p>
  		<p class="homa">The lens through which we view every consulting engagement is a Parallax View, which of course, as the definition of "parallax" suggests, means that we take<p class="homa">two alternate (but not necessarily opposing) views of every problem, and compare and contrast two alternate strategies for approaching the problem. This</p> <p class="homa">This ensures that individuals, teams and management do not become victims of their own paradigms (read Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</p><p class="homa">for more on this), that we don't get lazy, and that we can assure our clients of the deepest and most creative approaches to their problems, every time.</p>
	
	    <p class="homee">A Parallax Perspective</p>
	<p class="homa">As we use the term, we mean taking a look at a task, assignment, problem from two different points-of-view. To do this, we assign two different teams to <p class="homa">engage with an assignment and develop their own points of view, and then present their views to three referees, who then decide, based on the information </p> <p class="homa">that we have, which is the better initial path to pursue. But that is only the beginning of the process</p>
	<p class="homaw"> Throughout the engagement, we continue to use both points of view as a way of illuminating <p class="homaw" > the "space between them," and achieve greater clarity of observation and effectiveness of action.</p> <p class="homaw" >In this way, we protect ourselves from falling victim to reinforcing our own paradigms.</p> <p class="homaw" >Modeled after the great Greek Philosophy, our Parallax view outlines two opposing approaches to the problems</p>
<p class="homaw" >we try to collaborate with our clients and resolve. On one hand we use empiricism, viewing what we know from.</p>
<p class="homaw" >the physical (senses) perspective. We see, we feel, we acquire through being on the ground, talking to people, </p>
<p class="homaw" >observing, touching others creations. On the other hand we use rationalism, thinking, reasoning, hypothesizing .</p>
<p class="homaw" >and abstracting on the way to determine possible courses of action. We also use ethics, the deep understanding of.</p>
<p class="homaw" >good and bad, right or wrong, just or not – in short morality.</p>
